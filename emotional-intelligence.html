      <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong><br><br>
      The ability to perceive, understand and manage your own and other people's emotions. This awareness can be used to guide thinking and behaviour.  According to Wikipedia the term first appeared in 1964. It gained popularity in the 1995 bestselling book Emotional Intelligence by science journalist Daniel Goleman. Goleman defined EI as an array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance.</li>

      <li><strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong><br><br>
        According to the Science ABC article What's The Difference Between EQ And IQ? » ScienceABC  "IQ measures cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills while  EQ measures emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is made up of five facets: self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, social skills and motivation. While it is possible to improve your IQ, it is believed that EQ is more flexible and can be improved through concerted and conscious efforts at self-improvement.".</li>
        <br><br>
        <li><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong><br><br>
          EQ is important because we are emotional beings.  Understanding your own and other’s emotions, differentiating between them, and using that knowledge to guide actions and behaviours is a key skill to develop. It can lead to success in work, relationships, family dynamics and personal health.</li>
