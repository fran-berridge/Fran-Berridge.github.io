  <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

  <body>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong><br><Br>
          My long-term goal is to become a Junior Developer.</li><br><br>
      <li><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong><br><br>
        My strengths are that I love to question and research to find answers. My limitations are that sometimes I go outside my MVP deliverables to research and design applications which can lead to longer timeframes.</li><br><br>
      <li><strong>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br><br>
        I need to learn to work to my core deliverables and work with Toggl and other applications to ensure I work within timebox expectations.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br><br>
        - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
<br><br>
- What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong><br><br>
I'll ensure that I always meet core deliverables by asking questions and communicating with facilitators and community reps. I'll also use the discord help desk or directly to tutors if I am struggling with any core learning aspects.</li><br><br>
<li><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong><br><br>
  As per above  will use the discord help desk and course tutors to seek help prior to deadlines</li><br><br>
  <li><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong><br><br>
    I expect the facilitation team to either answer my questions or to give me learning material that will support me to answer my questions via self-research.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong>
      <br><br>I have no specific block-out times.</li>
