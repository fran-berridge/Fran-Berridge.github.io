        <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong><br /><br />
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive, understand and manage
        your own and other people's emotions. This awareness can be used to
        guide thinking and behaviour. According to Wikipedia the term first
        appeared in 1964. It gained popularity in the 1995 bestselling book
        Emotional Intelligence by science journalist Daniel Goleman. Goleman
        defined EI as an array of skills and characteristics that drive
        leadership performance.

        <strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong><br /><br />
        According to the Science ABC article
        <a

          What's the difference between EQ and IQ?</a
        ><br />
        IQ measures cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills while EQ
        measures emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is made up of
        five facets: self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, social skills and
        motivation. While it is possible to improve your IQ, it is believed that
        EQ is more flexible and can be improved through concerted and
        consciousmefforts at self-improvement.".

        <strong>Why is EQ important</strong><br /><br />
        EQ is important because we are emotional beings. Understanding your own
        and other's emotions, differentiating between them, and using that
        knowledge to guide actions and behaviours is a key skill to develop. It
        can lead to success in work, relationships, family dynamics and personal
        health.
