    <h1>Explain a Time</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>When you were blocked on a simple problem</strong><br />
        I came across a simple problem in the first activity of the Javascript-Kata challenge as I did not realise that we needed to use dot notation.  The problem arose as when I started my Javascript journey, I had been completed exercises using both dot notation and then bracket notation without realising I was using two different forms of notation. <br>When starting the first activity I used bracket notation as in the previous exercise I had been researching Javascript methods and they had all been written in bracket notation.<br>This was an interesting problem because I thought that I was writing my Javascript code incorrectly. Problems solving methods I used were googling, trying something, attempting to read error messages, asking for help from peers and coaches and moving onto the next question while waiting for support.<br>I was able to get advise from a tutor who explained the difference between dot and bracket notation.  I had also reached out to one of my peers who had also used bracket notation so was able to share my newfound knowledge of dot notation. This meant I could go through all my answers and modify them to bracket notation.<br>From this activity I should have learnt the difference between dot and bracket notation.  I would also like to have learnt to ask questions earlier but I came across another problem later in the kata and was reluctant to ask for help.  I will explain this in more detail under the section ‘Explain a time when you were reluctant to ask for help’.<br>

      <li>
        <strong
          >Elegantly(?) solved a problem</strong
        ><br />In this example, I am meant to explain a time when I elegantly solved a problem.  Personally, I would use the adjective ‘Elegant’ to describe my methods for solving any of the Javascript-Kata exercises. I will instead discuss a time I was ‘successful’ in solving one of the exercises using problem solving methods.<br>During the ‘whereAreYou’ activity I was asked to split a string into individual words before filtering out the buzzing words.  I used my prior knowledge of the exercises to copy and paster the index.test.js information to my de.Bee page as a guide to what I was meant to complete and then read a few google pages to understand the method of splitting strings into individual words.  With this information and a few syntax corrections from ChatGPT I was able to complete the activity without needing ask for support which felt amazing.  This made me feel elevated and like I could succeed in writing some Javascript code.<br></li>
        <br><br><li>
        <strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</strong
          ><br>Throughout the challenge I used a range of problem-solving techniques including the below:
          <ul>
          <li>
            Pseudocode
          </li>
          <li>
            Tyring something
          </li>
          <li>
            Rubber ducky method
          </li>
          <li>
            Attemptng to read error messages
          </li>
          <li>
            Googling
          </li>
          <li>
            Posting questions on discord
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking for support from peers and tutors
          </li>
          <li>
            Reflecting on my process
          </li>
          </ul>
      <br /><br />
          <li>
            <strong
              >Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</strong
            ><br />In sprint 4, I spent time working through and researching the human skills section of the sprint.  I really enjoyed completing research and learning about how the brain functions and techniques that can be used to logically work through problems. When I started working on the tech challenge, I looked at the foundations helpdesk and it looked like everyone was further ahead and understanding simple concepts om javascript that I was still learning.  This made me feel constantly behind and I never really caught up with the group.  Next time I need to work on the tech challenges first and ask for help earlier so I feel less pressure and anxiety when working through technical challenges.<br><br>
