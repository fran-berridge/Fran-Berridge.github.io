        Within one of my workplaces one of my colleagues had some health issues.
        His work was exceptional, although he was introverted he/she still
        interacted well with colleagues and stakeholders and his/her attendance
        was not an issue. The manager was clearly not happy about his/her
        specific health issues but had not raised them with the staff member.
        One day he/she went over to the colleagues desk and raised an issue in
        an open plan working environment that should have been raised in private
        meeting room. When the employer raised their voice the staff member told
        them in colourful word to leave. I went over to my colleague to see if
        they were ok and we went into a meeting room to talk. A few days later
        the manager gave the staff member a formal process. The staff member
        showed me the letter and I offered to support them through the HR
        process. This put me in an awkward position as the manager was in my
        wider team. This is where I had to use my morals and ethics. I had
        witnessed the incident and although the staff member had used
        inappropriate language at the end of the incident to tell her to leave.
        The conversation should never have occurred in an open workspace
        environment, the manager should not have raised her voice and with the
        person being an introvert he had tried his best to avoid conflict
        through words prior to his phase. When I reflect on my decision I feel
        it was the logical thing to do. Both staff members had a voice in the HR
        process and giving an hest account of what happened was the right thing
        to do. Based on the evidence provided HR dismissed the claims and my
        colleague was able to continue working.

        I am a mother, a member of the PTSG at my daughters school and now s
        student with Dev Academy. At my old work we had a work whanau which
        influenced my decisions both as a member of my team and a leader within
        our organisation. I try to meet deadlines set within projects because I
        understand that deliverables are important to meet implementation
        deadlines. I also am a realist and have worked in a high pressure
        projects where issues can mean that meeting deliverables are not always
        possible. In these cases I try and raise issues and adapt deliverable in
        a collaborate way so teams and key stakeholders have all the information
        needed to make decisions. Having an open and supportive culture within
        teams means that issues are able to be escalated and that solutions can
        be worked through by the team rather than blame being placed on one
        person.

        Within the Clifton strengths finder my top strength was Futuristic this
        is an interesting strength. A description of this strength is that
        people who have this trait make sense of where we are going today by
        forecasting that into the future it falls into the strategic thinking
        category themes. I can use this strength within the course and future
        employment opportunities to inspire hope by communicating what I
        envisage to possible in the future. Through blue sky thinking exercises
        I can support collaborate sessions where the sky is the limit, and we
        can think outside the box and not be limited by current state IT budget
        or staff resources. I also feel that communicate is one of my key
        strengths as I am not scared to reach out for support to enhance
        community of practice meeting, practice development, capability and tool
        development.

        I tend to think outside of the box and sometimes my ideas can mean that
        MVP timeframe deliverables may be extended for an idea to come to
        fruition. Although this is a limit for MVP deliverables if we work
        through sensible project planning and roadmaps some ideas are possible
        when you look at the overall enhancement to staff capability and
        productivity.

        When I was a Practice Lead one of my deliverables was to implement a
        Capability Assessment for Business Process Management kaimahi.
        Capability Assessment tools had already been implemented in the Business
        Analysis and Service Design areas via an Excel spreadsheet. Rather than
        implementing the exact same tool and just modifying the questions for my
        Practice I decided to evaluate the tools that were already in use and
        run brainstorming and prototyping sessions with the BPM Practice to
        develop a tool that worked best for our Practice. There was some
        resistance amongst the other Practice Leads to this idea as instead of a
        quick roll out it meant actually using the BPM methodology to ensure we
        were going through the discovery, analysis, options, design and
        implementation framework. Through working collaboratively with Practice
        Leads, kaimahi and other key stakeholders I was able to develop options
        for tools including Excel, Microsoft forms and Qualtrics. The end result
        was that I rolled out a tool through Qualtrics that everyone was happy
        with. Reflections from my colleagues were that although they were
        sceptical at the start of the discovery phase through working through
        the BPM framework and including all stakeholders in the design instead
        of just rolling out a tool the project had been a success. I had 100% of
        Kaimahi complete the tool as it was easy, intuitive and only included
        key questions relevant to BPM Capability Development.
