        <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong><br />
        My long-term goal is to become a Junior Developer.

          >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning</strong
        ><br />
        My strengths are that I am enquisative and love to research and analysis
        information, question options and collaborate to work through solution
        designs. My limitations are that sometimes I go outside my MVP
        deliverables to research and design products which can lead to longer
        timeframes.

          >What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        ><br />
        I would like to develop stress management techniques to support my
        mental health when working towards deliverables within tight timeframes.
        Using applications like Toogl will also ensure I work within timebox
        expectations.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong
          >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:<br /><br />
          - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
          <br /><br />
          - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you</strong
        ><br />
        I'll ensure that I always meet core deliverables by asking questions and
        communicating with facilitators and subject matter experts. I'll also
        use the discord help desk or reach out to tutors if I am struggling with
        any core learning aspects.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong
          >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way</strong
        ><br />
        As per above will endeavour to use the discord help desk and course
        tutors to seek help prior to deadlines.

      <li>
        <strong
          >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong
        ><br />
        If I have questions related to the learning material, I expect the
        facilitation team to support me to undersstand the question being asked,
        guide me towards learning material or support me in other ways that
        enhance my learning.
