    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway??</strong
        ><br />
        I enrolled in this course to obtain the technical and soft skills I need
        to become a junior developer. My hope this course will enhance my
        capability within web development and human skills. This will ensure
        that I not only meet entry level requirements for the role but also add
        value and support a positive team culture.

          >What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?</strong
        ><br />
        After 5 weeks of foundations learning I have re-evaluated my strengths
        and limitations for Bootcamp. A strength outlined in my original
        evaluation was that I was inquisitive and enjoyed research, analysing
        information, questioning and collaborating to work through solution
        designs. I still believe that I have strengths in this area but I now
        understand that computational thinking is a skill I need to develop.
        <br /><br />
        Breaking down complex problems using problem solving methods is an
        important skill within coding. I found during foundations that my
        limited knowledge of Javascript was a barrier when working through
        problems. I was able to use other problem solving methods to work
        towards solutions but this does that additional time. I feel that my
        technical knowledge will grow over my career but during Bootcamp I will
        have to focus on understanding the coding basics and seeking peer and
        tutor support if I am unable to work through errors in my code
        independently.

          >What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?</strong
        ><br />
        I think that my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be to
        juggle my family life around a full time course. I currently drop my
        daughter at school every day and when the course begins my daughter will
        need to walk to school so that I can drive into Wellington. My daughter
        has had some separation issues in the past so I am nervous that this
        change in routine will be a difficult transition for her.

          >What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        ><br />
        A non-technical skill I would like to develop on this course is my
        listening skills. I come from a neurodiverse family and sometimes in
        group meetings I can unintentionally interrupt people. I find this
        really embarrassing as within meetings listening skills are crucial.
        During foundations I enjoyed the listening and looping activity and I
        hope to develop the skill of mindful listening during Bootcamp.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong
        ><br />
        My expectations from the Bootcamp team reflect my previous expectations
        of the Foundations Team. Questions are an important part of the learning
        process. If I am confused during the course and ask for support I hope
        the tutors can support me firstly to understand the problem that is
        being outlined and secondly can either guide me towards technical
        learning material or support me in other ways to work through problems I
        am struggling to comprehend.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong
        ><br />
        During Bootcamp I will be based mainly on campus so I will be more
        proactive in asking for support from peers and tutors. With flipped
        learning I feel that it is much easier to spend excessive amounts of
        time trying to work through problems as you are remote. I am committed
        to attending Bootcamp, engaging in individual, pair and group activities
        and using the weekend to reflect on what I have learnt during the week.
        I will also write daily goals in a journal and try to reflect on these
        at the end of each day.

    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong><br />
        My long-term goal is to become a Junior Developer.

        <strong
          >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning</strong
        ><br />
        My strengths are that I am enquisative and love to research and analysis
        information, question options and collaborate to work through solution
        designs. My limitations are that sometimes I go outside my MVP
        deliverables to research and design products which can lead to longer
        timeframes.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong
          >What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        ><br />
        I would like to develop stress management techniques to support my
        mental health when working towards deliverables within tight timeframes.
        Using applications like Toogl will also ensure I work within timebox
        expectations.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong
          >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:<br /><br />
          - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
          <br /><br />
          - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you</strong
        ><br />
        I'll ensure that I always meet core deliverables by asking questions and
        communicating with facilitators and subject matter experts. I'll also
        use the discord help desk or reach out to tutors if I am struggling with
        any core learning aspects.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong
          >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way</strong
        ><br />
        As per above will endeavour to use the discord help desk and course
        tutors to seek help prior to deadlines.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        <strong
          >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong
        ><br />
        If I have questions related to the learning material, I expect the
        facilitation team to support me to understand the question being asked,
        guide me towards learning material or support me in other ways that
        enhance my learning.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
          in.</strong
        >
        <br />I have no specific block-out times.
