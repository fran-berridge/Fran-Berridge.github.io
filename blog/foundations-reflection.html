          >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming? </strong
        ><br /><br />
        Soft skills such as your values, empathy and self-awareness are
        non-technical skills that valuable for both learning, problem solving
        and programming. Our empathy and values feed into our emotional
        intelligence, these are important when building team and stakeholders
        relationships within a work environment. In relation to programming our
        empathy can help us to understand the customers' requirements when
        confirming their wants and needs.

          >What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills
          learning?</strong
        ><br /><br />
        I found the information about neuroplasticity fascinating. I have always
        believed in lifelong learning but it was surprising to find out that we
        exercise the neurons in our brain to strengthen memory and emotional
        regulation skills. Relating this to learning programming, when learning
        a new skill you brain creates new neuron pathways, which make new
        connections. This means that repeating new programming actions we have
        learnt reinforces the connection our brain has made and enhances our
        brain plasticity.

          >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?</strong
        ><br /><br />
        Human skills are important when it comes to having empathy,
        communication skills, a focus on continuous learning, attention to
        detail, focus, persistence, process management and so much more.<br />
        A quote from founder of this course summs up this question in two
        sentences: <br />
        "To be a good web developer, study code. To be a great one, study
        people." Joshua Vial, Founder of Dev Academy

          >Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong
        ><br /><br />
        Human skills are an important part of this course and relate not only to
        web development but all industries. Often technical skills can be learnt
        on the job but human skills are developed over time and a lot harder to
        teach. An example of this in the workplace is the ability to understand
        Critical Customer Requirements (CCR). Soft skills give employees the
        ability to ask questions and liase with customers and key stakeholders
        to ensure customer needs and wants are understood. Computational
        thinking is also an important skill as this capability enables
        indivudals and teams to break down complex problems using problem
        solving methods.
