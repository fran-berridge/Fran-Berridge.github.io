    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
  <ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</strong><br /> 
    Neuroplasticity broken down refers to  "Neuro" the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord and plasticity referring to "change". Brain plasticity allows you to learn new skills, gather and use new information and even has the ability to help you recover from brain injury. 
  </li>
   <br /><br />
  <li>
    <strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</strong><br>
    Every time you learn a new capability or skill your brain creates new connections.  Repeating those actions reinforces the connections which enable you to remember what you have learnt. Within this course I aim to code every day.  This repetition will not only support my understanding of the new concepts I am learning but also exercise my brain and strengthen my memory when it comes to learning coding languages.</li><br>
    <li>
      <strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong><br>
      Meditation is one way that I can support positive neuroplasticity changes within my brain.  Meditation, specifically mindfulness practice has been shown to enhance focus and attention and prevent cognitive decline.  By completing a 'Daily Calm" meditation for 10min each day prior to completing my study I can help calm my mind and allow my mind to open to the new learning and concepts for the upcoming sprints.</li><br>

    <h1>Growth Mindsets</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</strong><br>
      A growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and mindsets.   People with a growth mindset believe that challenges support learning opportunities and that you actually learn from your errors and the neurons in your brain form new stronger connections. Instead of think "I canâ€™t do this" your mindset is "I can't do this YET".</li><br>
      <li>
      <strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong>
      Prior to the course starting I had completed the prep curriculum which covered Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindsets. I found that researching these concepts again and rewatching the videos strengthened my understanding of these concepts and hopefully helped my neurons to make stronger connections into how my brain works and how I can enhance my learning journey on this course.</li><br>
      <li><strong >How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong><br>
      When I am programming if my code fails I will be more positive.  Instead of thinking 'I can't do this it's too hard'. I will give it a go and learn from my mistakes.  Having a growth mindset will help the neurons in my brain to make new connections and grow.</li><br>

      <h1>Learning Plan and Strategies</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</strong><br>
      My learning plan focuses on my goal to become a Junior developer. Soft skills like encourporating meditation into my daily routine and understanding the importance of having a growth mindset will support me with stress management techniques when I am under pressure to deliver projects within llimited timeframes.</li>
